# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# This template file has been automatically created at the following
# path since Ghostty couldn't find any existing config files on your system:
#
#   /Users/jeromeolverasanchez/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config
#
# The template does not set any default options, since Ghostty ships
# with sensible defaults for all options. Users should only need to set
# options that they want to change from the default.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.
#
# Ghostty can reload the configuration while running by using the menu
# options or the bound key (default: Command + Shift + comma on macOS and
# Control + Shift + comma on other platforms). Not all config options can be
# reloaded while running; some only apply to new windows and others may require
# a full restart to take effect.

# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
# # separated by equals signs.
# font-family = Iosevka
# window-padding-x = 2
#
# # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
# # All of these are identical:
# key=value
# key= value
# key =value
# key = value
#
# # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
# # a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a
# # part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
# background = #123abc
#
# # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.
# key =
#
# # Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value,
# # which is explained in the docs for that config option.
# # Just for example:
# resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms

# Theme
theme = Apple System Colors Light

# Font
font-family = ""
font-family = "Fantasque Sans Mono"
font-size = 18

# Spacing
window-padding-x = 15
window-padding-y = 15

# Cursor
cursor-style = block
cursor-style-blink = false

# Keep cursor style stable (shell integration often sets a bar at prompt).
shell-integration-features = no-cursor

# Behavior
copy-on-select = true

# Make unsafe pastes require confirmation.
clipboard-paste-protection = true

# Clipboard security posture: allow writes, but ask before reads (OSC 52 etc.).
clipboard-write = allow
clipboard-read = ask

# Prevent invisible/low-contrast text when apps pick bad colors.
minimum-contrast = 1.1

# More usable scrollback (bytes, per surface). 64MiB is a good baseline.
scrollback-limit = 67108864

# Ergonomics
mouse-hide-while-typing = true
mouse-shift-capture = never
right-click-action = copy-or-paste

# Aesthetics: balance remainder pixels around the grid.
window-padding-balance = true

# Defense-in-depth: keep title reporting disabled (should already be the default).
title-report = false

# Disable bell/attention/title indicators.
bell-features = no-system,no-audio,no-attention,no-title,no-border

# Ensure new windows use the configured font-size (instead of inheriting).
window-inherit-font-size = false

# Optional: if you want more vertical breathing room like Hyper's lineHeight=1.6,
# start small and tune (wrong values can make the grid unusable):
adjust-cell-height = 5%
